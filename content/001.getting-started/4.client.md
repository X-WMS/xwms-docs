## User Authentication

XWMS provides a secure, multi-step login and registration system featuring 2FA, OAuth, threat detection, and smart recovery.

## Partner (Client) Setup

If you are a business or developer integrating with XWMS, the Partner section lets you create and manage clients for OAuth and API access.

### Key Partner Docs:
- **[Client (Partner) Dashboard](/client/dashboard)**  
  Create clients, configure OAuth scopes, secrets, domains, and manage user access and verification.

- **[Client OAuth Setup](/client/developers)**  
  Secure API authentication libraries and integration examples, including Laravel setup and multi-language API prompts.
