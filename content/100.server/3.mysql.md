## What is an SSH tunnel?

An SSH tunnel creates a secure connection between your computer and your server. You connect a local port on your computer to a port on the server, giving you local access to, for example, a database or web application running on the server.

---

## Requirements

- A server with SSH access
- The SSH private key (or password)
- Access to a MySQL database on the server
- A local SSH client (such as OpenSSH or Git Bash on Windows)

---

## Step 1: Create a script to set up a tunnel

Create a new text file with the extension `.bat` (for example, `start-tunnel.bat`) and add the following lines. Adjust the variables to your situation:

```
@echo off
REM === Configuration ===
set PRIVATE_KEY="C:\path\to\your\private_key.pem"
set REMOTE_USER=root
set REMOTE_HOST=example.com
set LOCAL_PORT=8080
set REMOTE_PORT=80

echo Starting SSH tunnel...
ssh -i %PRIVATE_KEY% -L %LOCAL_PORT%:127.0.0.1:%REMOTE_PORT% %REMOTE_USER%@%REMOTE_HOST%
```

pause

Save the file and double-click it to start the tunnel. If everything is correct, you can connect to the service on your server via your browser or client.

---

## Step 2: Open the tunnel in your browser

Once the tunnel is active, you can go to this URL in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

Replace the port number `8080` if you've set a different port.

## Step 3: Reset the MySQL root password (optional)

If you can't log in to the MySQL database, you can reset the password. Follow these steps on the server:

1. Stop MySQL with the following command:
```
sudo systemctl stop mysql
```

2. Start MySQL in safe mode (without password checking):
```
sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
```

3. Log in to MySQL without a password:
```
mysql -u root
```

4. If you receive an error about a socket, first run the following:
```
sudo mkdir -p /var/run/mysqld
sudo chown mysql:mysql /var/run/mysqld
sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
mysql -u root
```

5. In MySQL, run the following to change the password:

```
USE mysql;
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'new_password';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

6. Stop and restart MySQL:

```
sudo killall mysqld
sudo systemctl start mysql
```

7. Test if the password works:

```
mysql -u root -p
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What if I don't have a private key?**

You can also connect with your user password, but SSH keys are more secure and recommended.

**Can I use a port other than 8080?**
Yes, as long as the port is free on your computer.

**Does this also work with other databases like PostgreSQL?**
Yes, as long as you know which port the database is listening on.
