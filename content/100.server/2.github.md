## 1. Generate an SSH Key and Add it to GitHub

If you don't have an SSH key yet, create one (make sure you're logged in as the user you're working with):

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"

Follow the steps and leave the passphrase blank or enter it if you wish.

### 1.2 Copy Public Key

Copy the public SSH key to your clipboard:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### 1.3 Add the SSH key to GitHub

- Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
- Click **New SSH key**
- Paste your public key into the field
- Give it a meaningful name
- Click **Add SSH key**

---

## 2. Test SSH Connection to GitHub

Test if the connection is working:

```
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You will receive a message like this:

```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

If you receive a `Permission denied` message, check if you added the correct key and try again.

## 3. Create the Project Directory

Create a new directory (change `yourproject` to your project name):

```
mkdir -p /var/www/yourproject
cd /var/www/yourproject
```

### 3.2 Clone the GitHub Repository

Use SSH to clone the project (change the URL to your repository):

```
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git .
```

> Note the period `.` at the end; this will clone the contents directly into the current directory.

---

## 4. Set Access Permissions

Ensure the correct user is the owner of the folder:

```
sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/domain
sudo find /var/www/domain -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
sudo find /var/www/domain -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
sudo chmod g+s /var/www/domain
sudo chown -R xwmsdev:group /var/www/domain
sudo chmod -R g+rw /var/www/domain
sudo chmod -R g+s /var/www/domain
```

---

## 5. Further Use

From now on, you can simply run `git pull` and `git push` within `/var/www/yourproject` with your user without having to enter passwords each time.

---

## Common issues

- **SSH key not recognized?**
Make sure you're running `ssh-agent` and your private key is loaded.

- **Wrong permissions?**
Check the file owner and group.

- **Connection refused?**
Make sure you have internet access and GitHub is reachable.

---

With these steps, your project is in `/var/www` and you're ready to continue working. **Success!**
