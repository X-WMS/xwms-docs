  title: Managing File Permissions and Groups for Your Web Project
  description: When managing a web project on a Linux server, such as a Laravel application in `/var/www`, it's important to set the correct file permissions and user groups. This ensures security, collaboration, and proper operation of your application.
---

## 1. Why use groups?

- Groups allow you to give multiple users the same permissions to certain folders and files.
- For example: the web server (`www-data`) and your own user must both have write permissions in the project folder.
- By adding a group and making both users members, you prevent permission issues.

---

## 2. Create a Group

First, create a new group, for example, `webgroup`:

```
sudo groupadd webgroup
```

---

## 3. Add Users to the Group

Add the web server user (`www-data`) and your own user to this group:

```
sudo usermod -aG webgroup www-data
sudo usermod -aG webgroup yourusername
```

> **Tip:** Replace `yourusername` with your own username on the server.

---

## 4. Assign Permissions to Folders and Files

Now set the correct permissions on your project folder (for example, `/var/www/yourproject`):

- Give read, write, and execute permissions to the owner and group (775) for folders.
- Give read and write permissions (664) to files for the owner and group.

Run the following commands: 

```
sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/yourproject 
sudo find /var/www/yourproject -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \; 
sudo find /var/www/yourproject -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
```

---

## 5. Set group as default for new files (setgid)

By setting the `setgid` bit on directories, new files and directories automatically inherit the group of the parent directory:

```
sudo chmod g+s /var/www/yourproject
```

---

## 6. Change file owner and group

Ensure the owner is the correct user (for example, `yourusername`) and the group is `webgroup`:

```
sudo chown -R yourusername:webgroup /var/www/yourproject
```

---

## 7. Grant group read and write permissions

Give the group read and write permissions on all files and directories:

```
sudo chmod -R g+rw /var/www/yourproject
```

---

## 8. Verify success

Log in as the user (`yourusername`) and check the permissions:

```
ls -l /var/www/yourproject/composer.json
```

You should see something like:

```
-rw-rw-r-- 1 yourusername webgroup 12345 Sep 5 12:00 composer.json
```

This means that the owner and group have read and write permissions.

---

## 9. Repeat if necessary

For changes or new files, it is sometimes necessary to repeat these steps to keep permissions consistent.

---

## Summary of commands

```
sudo groupadd webgroup
sudo usermod -aG webgroup www-data
sudo usermod -aG webgroup yourusername

sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/yourproject
sudo find /var/www/yourproject -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
sudo find /var/www/yourproject -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
sudo chmod g+s /var/www/yourproject
sudo chmod -R yourusername:webgroup /var/www/yourproject
sudo chmod -R g+rw /var/www/yourproject
```

---

These settings ensure that you and the web server can collaborate on the project files without any security issues or file permission conflicts.
**Good luck managing your server files!**
