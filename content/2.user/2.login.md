## Getting Started

XWMS provides one of the most secure and intelligent login systems in the world. Logging in is not just about entering an email and password ‚Äî it's a smart, multi-functional system built to balance user convenience with strict security.

There are multiple ways to log in, which we‚Äôll go over step by step, from most common to more advanced options.

---

## üîê Standard Email & Password Login

### Step 1: Email Input

From the homepage, click on **Login** or **Get Started** in the top-right corner.

> ‚úÖ If you already see **My Account**, you're already logged in.

On the login tab:

- Enter your **email address** in the input field.
- Click **Next**.

If the email is valid and associated with an account, you'll be taken to the password step.

### Step 2: Password Input

- Enter your **password**.
- If it's correct, you'll be immediately logged in.

> üîí But it's not always this simple. Depending on your account settings, additional steps may apply.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)

If the user has 2FA enabled, one of the following verification methods will be required:

- **Email Code**: You will be asked to enter a 6-digit code sent to your email.
- **Authenticator App**: You will be prompted to enter a code from your authenticator (e.g. Google Authenticator).

After completing the required 2FA method successfully, you'll be logged in.

---

## üö® Suspicious Login Detection

XWMS uses advanced algorithms to detect potentially dangerous login behavior (such as unfamiliar locations or devices). If you're flagged:

- You'll be **required** to complete a verification step (e.g. email code or authenticator).
- Failing this will **block the login attempt**.

> ‚úÖ Tip: For best results, log in from the same device and location you usually use.

---

## üîÑ OAuth Login (Google / Microsoft)

On the login tab, you can also choose to log in using:

- **Google**
- **Microsoft**

Clicking one of these will redirect you to the respective provider's authentication flow.

> üîÅ If the user has 2FA enabled, you‚Äôll still be prompted to verify after OAuth login is completed.

---

## üß† Remember Me

You can toggle the **"Remember Me"** switch on the login tab.

- When enabled, you'll stay logged in on the same device.
- When disabled, you‚Äôll be asked to log in again after your session expires.

---

## üîç Forgot Email

If you forgot your email, click on **"Forgot Email?"** on the login tab.

You‚Äôll be taken to a smart recovery tab, where you can enter:

- Parts of your name
- Date of birth
- Known email fragments
- Any other relevant info

> üéØ XWMS will search and show a list of matching accounts.

Select the correct account and click **Next** to continue to the password step.

---

## ‚ùì Forgot Password

If you forgot your password, click **"Forgot Password"** from the login screen.

You‚Äôll go through the following steps:

### Step 1: Email Verification

- A 6-digit code is sent to your email.
- Enter this code into the input fields.
- Click **"Verify Code"** (not "Next").

### Step 2: Reset Your Password

Once verified, a password reset form will appear on the **same tab**.

- Enter your new password.
- Repeat the password to confirm.
- Click **Login**.

If everything checks out, you‚Äôll be logged in immediately.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Again: Suspicious behavior may trigger security checks. Logging in from the same device and location helps avoid this.
