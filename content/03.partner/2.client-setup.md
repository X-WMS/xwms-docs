# Getting Started with XWMS Clients & OAuth

This page is your **starting point** for connecting an external app
(website, dashboard, mobile app, …) to XWMS using OAuth.

You will:

- create or open a **Client (Partner)** in XWMS  
- configure **domains, scopes and secrets**  
- learn where to find the values your app needs (`client id`, `secret`, `domain`, …)  
- see where to go for **language‑specific code examples**  

Even if you are not a developer, this page should help you understand
what is happening and what you need to give to your developers.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- You have an XWMS account and can log in.  
- You have at least one **Client (Partner)** or you can create one.  
- For OAuth you need a **paid account** to access the Clients dashboard.

If needed, see the user login docs first:  
[Login to XWMS](/user/login)

---

## 2. Open the “My Clients” dashboard

1. Log in to XWMS.  
2. Go to your **Account Dashboard**.  
3. Click **“My Clients”** in the navigation.

If you have no clients yet, XWMS will ask you to create your first one.

---

## 3. Create or select a Client

To create a new client:

1. Click **“Create Client”** (or similar).  
2. Enter a clear name, for example `mycompany-main-app`.  
3. Confirm.

You will be taken to the **Client Dashboard** where you can configure:

- **Integrations** (Domains, Scopes, Secrets, Users)  
- **Verification Center**  
- **Members & Roles**  

This Client represents one “integration” or “partner application”.

---

## 4. Configure Integrations for OAuth

Open the **Integrations** section for your client.  
Here you’ll configure three things that every OAuth integration needs:

- **Domains** – where your app lives and where users are sent back to.  
- **Client Scopes** – what your app is allowed to see or do.  
- **Client Secrets** – keys used to prove that it’s really your app calling XWMS.  

### 4.1 Domains

1. Go to **Integrations → Domains**.  
2. Click **“New Domain”**.  
3. Fill in:
   - **Root Domain** – without protocol, e.g. `example.com`  
   - **Server IP Address** – IP of your server (if applicable)  
   - **Internal Name** – optional label for yourself  
4. Save.

After saving, you can configure details like:

- **Domain ID** – unique identifier used by XWMS  
- **Logo** – domain‑specific logo  
- **Fallback URI / Response** – where to send users if something goes wrong  

Important toggles:

- **Allow Login** – must be enabled for OAuth login.  
- **Allow API** – must be enabled to call XWMS APIs from this domain.  
- **Active** – the domain must be active.  
- **Primary Domain** – optional, marks the main domain.  
- **Test Mode** – mark as test environment if this is not production.

You will later give the **Domain** (or **Domain ID**) to your app/config.

### 4.2 Client Scopes

Scopes describe **what your app is allowed to access**.

1. Go to **Integrations → Client Scopes**.  
2. Click **“New Client Scope”**.  
3. Select the scopes you need, such as:
   - read basic user profile  
   - access address information  
   - read providers  
   - other business‑specific scopes  
4. Save.

Only the scopes you enable here can be used by your OAuth / API integration.

### 4.3 Client Secrets

Client secrets are like **passwords for your application**, not for the user.

1. Go to **Integrations → Client Secrets**.  
2. Click **“New Secret”**.  
3. Optionally provide:
   - a **label** (for example `production-backend`),  
   - an **expiration date**.

If you leave these empty:

- the secret will be named **Standard Key**,  
- it will be active immediately.

You will later copy this secret into your application’s `.env` file.

### 4.4 Link secrets to domains

To allow a secret to be used from a specific domain:

1. Open the **Domain**.  
2. Go to **Secret Connections** (or similar).  
3. Click **“Link Secret”** and choose the secret.  

Now calls from that domain using that secret are recognised as valid.

## 5. Where your developers get the technical details

Once your Client is configured, your developers need:

- **Client Id**  
- **Client Secret**  
- **Domain / Domain Id**  
- **Redirect URL** – the URL where XWMS should send users back after login  
- The **XWMS API URL** – usually `https://xwms.nl/api/`

For code examples and detailed flows, direct them to:

- [General OAuth Setup (AI prompt)](/partner/oauth-setup)  
- [JavaScript / Node.js Guide](/partner/oauth-setup/js)  
- [PHP Guide](/partner/oauth-setup/php)  
- [Laravel Guide](/partner/oauth-setup/laravel)  
- [Python Guide](/partner/oauth-setup/python)  

All those pages explain the same idea:

- start auth with `sign-token`  
- user logs in on XWMS  
- XWMS redirects back with a token  
- your app calls `sign-token-verify` and receives user data, including **`sub`**  
- your app links that stable `sub` to a local account

---

## 6. Client Users, Verification and Roles (optional but important)

### Client Users

Under **Integrations → Users** you can:

- see which XWMS users have logged in via your client/domain  
- send **access requests** or **test user requests**  

When a user accepts such a request, your client may gain access to
additional scopes (depending on your partnership level).

### Verification Center

In the **Verification Center** you can apply to become a **Verified Partner**:

1. Create a new verification request.  
2. Select the domains and scopes you need.  
3. Add notes to explain your use case.  

The XWMS team will review and approve/reject the request.
Verified partners can receive more powerful scopes.

### Members & Roles

The **Members** and **Roles** sections control who in your organisation
can manage the client:

- **Roles** define permissions (view users, manage scopes, etc.).  
- **Members** assign those roles to actual XWMS accounts.

This has no direct impact on OAuth tokens, but it is important for
who is allowed to change settings.

## 7. Summary

::list
- A **Client (Partner)** represents one external app or integration.
- Under **Integrations** you configure:
  - **Domains** (where your app runs and where users return after login),
  - **Client Scopes** (what your app may access),
  - **Client Secrets** (keys used by your backend).
- Secrets can be linked to domains to allow secure API and OAuth usage.
- Developers then use the values from this client in their code
  (see the language‑specific OAuth guides).
- Optional: **Client Users**, **Verification**, **Members & Roles**
  help you manage access and become a verified partner.

If you follow this page first and then open one of the OAuth guides,
you’ll have everything you need to build a clean, professional login
flow with XWMS.
