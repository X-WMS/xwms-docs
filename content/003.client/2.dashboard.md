## Overview

Once you're logged into your XWMS account (see [Login](/user/login)), you can begin setting up **Clients** — also known as **Partners**.

> ⚠️ You must have a **paid account** to access the "Clients" section.

---

## 🔍 Accessing "My Clients"

- From the **Account Dashboard**, click on **"My Clients"** in the top-left corner.
- If you haven't created any clients yet, you'll be prompted to **create your first client**.

---

## ➕ Creating a New Client

Enter a name for your client (e.g. `mijnbedrijf1`) and click **Create**.

You’ll be taken to the **Client Dashboard** where you can manage integrations, domains, users, and more.

---

## 🔌 Integrations

Inside the Client Dashboard, go to the **Integrations** section. Here you’ll find:

- **Domains**
- **Client Scopes**
- **Client Secrets**

---

## 🎯 Client Scopes

1. Click **"Client Scopes"**
2. Click **"New Client Scope"**
3. Choose the scopes you want to activate:
   - View user data
   - Access address information
   - Retrieve providers
   - ...and more
4. Click **"Create"**

> ✅ Activated scopes determine which data and actions are accessible via OAuth/API.

---

## 🔑 Client Secrets

1. Click on **"Client Secrets"**
2. Click **"New Secret"**
3. You can optionally provide:
   - A **label**
   - An **expiration date**

If left empty:
- The secret will be called **Standard Key**
- It will be active immediately

---

## 🌐 Domains

Click on **"Domains"** to add a new domain:

1. **Root Domain**: Enter without protocol (e.g. `xwms.nl`)
2. **Server IP Address**: Add your server IP
3. **Internal Name** (optional)

After saving, you can edit the domain settings.

### Domain Options:

- **Domain ID** (auto-generated)
- **Logo**: Upload a domain-specific logo
- **Fallback Response** (not recommended): Used if something fails
- **Fallback URI**: Redirect URL on failure

### Toggles:

- ✅ **Allow Login** – Enable OAuth login via this domain  
- ✅ **Allow API** – Permit API calls from this domain  
- ✅ **Active** – Marks the domain as active  
- ✅ **Primary Domain** – Set this as the main domain  
- ✅ **Test Mode** – Mark as test-only environment

---

## 📡 Domain URLs & Secret Connections

### Domain URLs

Add **Callback URLs** or **Webhook URLs**.

> 🧩 These URLs are **required** and must be active. Otherwise, XWMS will not send requests.

### Secret Connections

Link a secret to the domain:

- Click **"Link Secret"**
- Select the secret from the list

Now, this secret is usable for this domain.

---

## 👥 Client Users

Under **Integrations > Users**, you can:

- See which XWMS users have logged into your domain
- View basic stats (advanced stats may require payment)
- Send **Access Requests** or **Test User Requests** to specific users

> Users will receive a notification and can choose to accept. If accepted, you gain more access — including to certain scopes normally reserved for verified partners.

---

## 🛂 Verification Center

This section allows your organization to become a **Verified Partner**.

1. Click **"New Verification"**
2. Choose the **domains** and **scopes** you want to verify
3. Optionally add **notes** to support your request

A member of the XWMS team will review your application.

Once verified, your client gains access to extended scopes and privileges.

---

## 👤 Members & Roles

### Roles

1. Go to **Roles**
2. Click **"New Role"**
3. Fill in the role configuration:
   - Role Name (or enable **Custom Role Name**)
   - Role Key
   - Description
   - Permissions (e.g. `view users`, `delete users`, `update roles`, etc.)
   - Group (optional — auto-adds the role to the group)
   - Level
   - Expiration Date
   - Status (active/inactive)

### Members

1. Go to **Members**
2. Click **Add Member**
3. Select:
   - A user (searchable)
   - A role
   - (Optional) Expiration date

This adds a member to your client/partner organization with the selected permissions.
