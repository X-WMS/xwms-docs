## Getting Started

When you're logged in and go to **My Account**, you land on the main account dashboard. This area gives you access to various settings, including personal information, security, sessions, addresses, and more.

---

## 👤 General Information

The **General** section contains your core account information:

- **Profile Picture**
- **First Name**
- **Last Name**

You can modify all of these fields directly. Once you’re done editing:

- Click **Save Account Changes** to apply.

Changes are instant after saving.

## 🖥️ Active Sessions

The **Sessions** tab shows all active login sessions on your account.

Each session shows:

- **Device type**
- **Operating system**
- **Browser**
- **IP address**
- **Last active time**

You can click the **Delete** button to remove a session, which will log that device out.

> ⚠️ If the session is your current device, you won’t be able to delete it. It will say **“My Device”** under **Last Active**.

## 🔐 Security Settings

The **Security** tab allows you to update sensitive account data. Some actions require your account to be **unlocked** (either via email or 2FA).

### Change Password

1. Enter a new password and repeat it.
2. Click **Set New Password**.

> Password must be at least 8 characters, include an uppercase and lowercase letter, and a number.

If your account is **locked**, a verification step (email or 2FA) will be triggered before the password is changed. Once verified, the change is instant and your account remains unlocked for **15 minutes**.

### Change Email

1. Enter your new email.
2. Verify it via a code sent to the new address.

### Add Secondary Email

1. Enter your secondary email.
2. Verify it via a code sent to that address.

> Secondary emails help with recovery and notifications.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

We recommend setting up 2FA using a desktop browser:

- Click **Set Up 2FA**.
- Scan the QR code with your authenticator app.
- Enter the 6-digit code shown in your app to complete setup.

> 📱 If you’re using a phone, there's also a **“Open in Authenticator App”** button to make setup easier.

## 👤 Logout & Theme Toggle
