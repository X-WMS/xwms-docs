## Getting Started

XWMS provides one of the most advanced and secure authentication systems in the world. Unlike basic login forms, our system is built with multiple verification layers, animations, and intelligent input validation ‚Äî all designed to create a seamless and secure user experience.

When you open XWMS, you'll find a **Login** or **Get Started** button at the top-right of the homepage.

- If you see **My Account** instead, you're already logged in.
- To create a new account, scroll to the bottom-right of the login panel and click **Create Account**.

This will trigger a smooth animated transition into our multi-step account registration process.

## Step 1: Enter Your Name

You will be prompted to fill in your **First Name** and **Last Name**.

> ‚ùóÔ∏èOnly real names are allowed. Fake or suspicious names are blocked by our **advanced name checker**, which uses various algorithms to detect unrealistic entries.

Once completed, click **Next** to proceed.

---

## Step 2: Personal Information

You'll now see a new tab (with animation) asking for the following details:

- **Email address**
- **Date of Birth**
- **Gender**

This tab includes two navigation buttons:

- **Previous** ‚Äì Takes you back to the previous step **without resetting** your input.
- **Cancel** ‚Äì **Wipes all data** and restarts the entire registration process from scratch.

> üí° Use *Previous* if you made a minor mistake. Use *Cancel* if you want to restart completely.

When you're ready, click **Next**.

---

## Step 3: Create a Password

You'll now be asked to set up a secure password and confirm it.

> **Password Requirements:**
> - Minimum of 8 characters
> - At least one uppercase letter
> - At least one lowercase letter
> - At least one number

Click **Next** to proceed once your password meets the criteria.

---

## Step 4: Email Verification

A 6-digit verification code has been sent to your email.

### On this tab:

- Enter the 6-digit code in the input fields.
- As you type, the input **automatically advances** to the next field.
- **Pasting is supported**, even though it may look like it's not.
- Once all digits are entered, the code is **automatically validated**.

> ‚úâÔ∏è Didn't receive the code? Click **Resend Code** to send a new one to your email.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **No "Previous" button is available on this step** for security reasons. If you need to start over, click **Cancel** to wipe your session and restart registration.

Once you enter the code, click **Verify** to continue.

---

## Step 5: Human Verification

To finalize your registration, you‚Äôll be asked to complete a **CAPTCHA** to confirm you're not a robot.

Simply click the CAPTCHA box and then press **Finish**.

---

## Completion

Congratulations! üéâ

If all steps are completed successfully:

- You will be **automatically logged in**
- You'll be redirected to your **Account Dashboard**

From here, you can manage your profile, security settings, and much more.
